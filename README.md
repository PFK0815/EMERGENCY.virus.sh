This is the EMERGENCY.virus.sh virus by me.

# EMERGENCY.virus.sh<br/>
!! WARNING !! <br />
  We warn you to use this script! <br />
  Using at your own risk. <br />
__Information__ <br />
  Don't run this script as root. If you run as root it dont make any visible changes.
  But you still need to type your sudo password sometimes.
  Some Tasks listed down here need some time and are async.
__What is this virus doing?__ <br />
  Moving sudo from /usr/bin/sudo to /srv/EMERGENCY.virus.INFECTED!!! <br />
  Change your password to 'EMERGENCY.virus' and change root password to a randum number from 0-9. <br />
  Change your fullname to 'Password EMERGENCY.virus'. <br />
  Start some cpukiller. <br />
  Copy !MANY! spam files. <br />
  Adding !!MANY!! users. <br />
  Sending !MANY! notify-send messages. <br />
  Killing some processes every 0.25 seconds. <br />
  Changing hostname. <br />
How to fix all that?: <br />
  First find where i hide the invisible char in the moved sudo filename. The invisible char: U+200D <br />
  Change your password back. Find root's password and change it too. <br />
  Change your fullname. <br />
  cpukillers dont need any fix, they are turned off after system reboot. <br />
  Deleting all spam files. <br />
  Remove all other users, maybe you write a script for it. <br />
  Autoprocesskiller is fixed with reboot too. <br />
  notify-send messages are fixed after reboot. <br />
  Changing hostname. <br />
Note: <br />
  It's not possbile to run the sudo file from commandline. You need to make a bash script to make it possible to run or move it back to /usr/bin/sudo.
